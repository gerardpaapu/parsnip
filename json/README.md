This is intended to serve 3 purposes.

1. To parse JSON correctly

2. To serve as an example of a
   parser defined with the library

3. To serve as an additional source
   of useful composable parsers to use elsewhere

   e.g. JSON.Number, JSON.String

You'll need coffeescript, and GNU Make to build and vows to
run the tests

    make       # makes build/parsnip.json.js
    make test  # runs the test suite
    make clean # deletes files generated by the build
